    Test the computation of cosine distances in high-dimensional spaces with random vectors stored in an SQLite database.

    This function tests the accuracy and consistency of cosine distance calculations between vectors in different formats:
    - distance_cosine_f32(JSON, JSON)
    - distance_cosine_f32(BLOB, BLOB)
    - distance_cosine_f16(BLOB, BLOB)

    The vectors are stored and retrieved as JSON strings and as binary blobs (in both 32-bit and 16-bit precision formats).
    The function asserts that the cosine similarities computed from the different storage formats (JSON, f32 BLOB, f16 BLOB)
    are within a certain tolerance of each other, ensuring that the distance calculations are consistent across different data formats.

    Parameters:
        num_vectors (int): The number of random vectors to generate and test.
        ndim (int): The dimensionality of each vector.
